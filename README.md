# double_ended_sorts
C++ library full of two-sided versions of elementary sorts with (varying) support for unspecified containers and datatypes through templating and an STL-like approach to using iterators on iterator-able containers (eg std::vector)

## Includes:
- Double ended selection sort
  - Support for STL vectors, c-style arrays with size variable, and templated generic forward iterators

## Will include in the future:
- Double ended bubble sort
- Double ended insertion sort
